    "<h4 align=\"center\">Impact</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews provide objective feedback to a product and are therefore inherently useful for consumers. These ratings are often summarized by a numerical rating, or the number of stars. Of course there is more value in the actual text itself than the quantified stars. And at times, the given rating does not truly convey the experience of the product – the heart of the feedback is actually in the text itself. The goal therefore is to build a classifier that would understand the essence of a piece of review and assign it the most appropriate rating based on the meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4 align=\"center\">Background</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Though product ratings on Amazon are aggregated from all the reviews by every customer, each individual rating is actually only an integer that ranges from one star to five stars. This reduces our predictions to discrete classes totaling five possibilities. Therefore what we'll have is a supervised, multi-class classifier with the actual review text as the core predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is an exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of predicting the star rating given a piece of text will take on different NLP topics including word embedding, topic modeling, and dimension reduction. From there, we'll arrive at a final dataframe and we'll be employing different machine learning techniques in order to come up with the best approach (i.e. most accurate estimator) for our classifier.\n",

    "The [Amazon dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/index.html) contains the customer reviews for all listed *Electronics* products spanning from May 1996 up to July 2014.

    "*  **asin** - Unique ID of the product being reviewed, *string*\n",
    "*  **helpful** - A list with two elements: the number of users that voted *helpful*, and the total number of users that voted on the review (including the *not helpful* votes), *list*\n",

If we differentiate this base form from a modified version like \"*learning*\" then we might lose relational context between two documents that have used either word.\n",

Stemming is another common approach, although stemming only performs truncation and would not be able to reduce \"*taught*\" to \"*teach*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the *WordNetLemmatizer* from the Natural Language Toolkit (or *NLTK*). Lemmatization only applies to each word but it is dependent on sentence structure to understand context. We therefore need to have part-of-speech tags associated with each word. Our output is derived from applying the `lemmatize_doc` function to our `preprocessed` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `lemmatize_doc` works as follows:\n",
    "* Each review is broken down into a list of sentences\n",
    "* Punctuations that only group words or separate sentences (hyphens therefore are excluded) are removed (replaced by whitespace) using RegEx\n",
    "* Every sentence is further broken down into words (tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the sentences then becomes an ordered bag of words. Every word is then *tagged* to a part-of-speech. This word-tag tuple pair is then fed one at a time to the `lemmatize_word` function, which works as follows:\n",
    "* Only modifiable words – nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs – can be reduced to roots\n",
    "* These words are lemmatized and appended to the `root` list\n",
    "* Words that are not modifiable are added as they are to the `root` list\n",
    "\n",
    "The output lists are linked together as a string using whitespace. In the end, each `preprocessed` review will retain its text form but with each word simplified as much as possible."

    "# Conclusion #\n",
    "A lot of Natural Language Processing techniques were covered in the study. Just some of the concepts explored include topic modeling – where similar texts were clustered together according to topic, named entity recognition (NER) – where nouns were given identifying labels like *place* or *time*, and dependency trees – where parts-of-speech tags and sentence structure were discerned. Though the *Word2Vec* phase was central to our final model, the pre-processing steps were perhaps just as crucial. Prior to tokenization, each document had to be decoded from UTF and encoded to ASCII, and converted to lowercase. The texts were stripped of accents, stop words and punctuation, and multiple whitespaces were dropped. Words were simplified to their root words in order to compact the vocabulary as much as possible. Tokens that were often used together were also singularized through phrase modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond word use and word frequency, our model actually extracts and quantifies *context*. Every token in all the reviews are understood by their neighboring words and embedded in a given number of dimensions. All the interactions of a word with all the other words it has been associated with are expressed in vectors. And all the words in a given review are averaged according to each of the dimensions to create its 100 features. So the essence of a review by its words make up the final dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have is a multi-class model where each of the five classes correspond to a review’s star rating. This is then a discrete approach where each class is independent of each other. In a situation where a 5-star rating is misinterpreted by the model as a 1-star review, then the model has simply misclassified – it is agnostic to how far off `1` and `5` are. This is in contrast with a *continuous* approach whereas a misclassification of a 5-star review as a 1-star review would be more penalizing. Our model then is reliant on the distinction of each kind of review. It is more concerned in asking \"*What makes a 5-star review different from a 4-star review?*\" than asking \"*Is this review more approving than criticizing?*\"\n",

    "Though we have observed satisfactory results in our model compared to the baseline, there are several limitations in the way the model handles data. These could serve as areas of improvement. First, despite a rich vocabulary, the model will not be able to handle words that it has not encountered during training. In fact, if an unknown word appears in a review, the word is dropped from the dimension-averaging step since has not  been referenced in our `word_vec_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each word is simplified by lemmatization during pre-processing, then alternate forms of a token shouldn’t necessarily be a concern. However, the model cannot identify if a word is misspelled and will identify one simply as a new word. Incorporating a spellchecker would add to the computational cost and will certainly add to the model’s complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as is usually the case in NLP, sarcasm or text that is intended to be ironic is interpreted by what is literally in the text and not by its underlying context. Because sarcasm is usually detected by readers through the mood and sentiment of the document, it takes adding another layer of NLP just to approximate whether the review is sarcastic or not in order to properly work with such text. This supplement layer will not only utilize tagged sarcastic text as supervised labels, but must also consider the review’s given product rating in its judgment to detect sarcasm."
